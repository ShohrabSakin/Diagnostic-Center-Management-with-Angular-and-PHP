# 	Diagnostic Center Management

This project attempted to develop a web-based, computer-aided management system for all Diagnostic Center. Our main goal is to make this app available to most retail diagnostic labs that require small customization points for each diagnostic lab in the implementation phase. This system has been developed to overcome all the challenges associated with managing locally and manually processed diagnoses.
